## About

This project predicts student performance using machine learning models. The app allows users to explore datasets, make predictions, and visualize results through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

---

## Features

- Load student performance dataset  
- Preprocess and display data  
- Predict scores using a pre-trained model (`model.sav`)  
- Interactive visualizations via Streamlit
